# Framework Laptop 16 M.2 Cellular Modem Expansion Bay Module

This repository holds the WIP design files for a module for the Framework Laptop 16's Expansion Bay allowing for the connection of a standard M.2 B-Key cellular modem.
It was designed for usage with Quectel RM50X / RM5X0-series 5G modules, but other 3.7V-tolerant modules are expected to work as well.

FIXME: elaborate on design decisions (i.e. PCI-E over USB, 3.7V VCC voltage, I2C / EC stuff, ...)
